## D-9 · 2026-10-23 · .gitignore covers dependencies, build output, secrets and the design bundle
Ignored: `node_modules/`, `out/`, `dist/`, `release/`, logs, `.env*`, OS and editor files, and the design handoff folder and zip. The relevant design assets (tokens, fonts, glyphs, components) are copied into `src/` so the app doesn't depend on the bundle.
Why: user asked for a gitignore up front so unneeded files never get committed. This refines D-008, which left the handoff untracked.
