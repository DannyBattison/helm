## D-21 · 2026-10-23 · Plan usage comes from Claude Code's rate-limit events
The SDK emits `rate_limit_event` messages with `unifiedWindows.five_hour` and `seven_day` utilisation as fractions plus reset times (verified against the user's account). helm stores the latest values and shows them as the 5-hour and weekly meters. In subscription mode the user can set percentage limits for each window; reaching one pauses running sessions into "Needs you" with a "Continue anyway" action that lasts until that window resets.
Why: it is the real subscription usage, not an estimate from dollar costs.
