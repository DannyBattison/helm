## D-19 · 2026-10-23 · GitHub OAuth client ID is built in
The registered OAuth app's client ID (`Ov23liTYcKE5lBWCEAAV`) is the default in `src/main/store.ts`, so sign-in no longer asks for it. The sign-in field only appears if the setting is empty, and Settings → Account keeps an override. `HELM_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` still wins when set. Supersedes the "ask for it" part of D-005.
Why: client IDs are public, and asking every user for one was the wrong experience once the app was registered.
