## D-3 · 2026-10-23 · Claude sessions run through the Claude Agent SDK
Sessions use `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` `query()` with streaming input, `canUseTool` for approvals and questions, `interrupt()` for Esc, and `resume` to continue after an app restart. Models are chosen by alias (sonnet, opus, haiku) so they don't go stale.
Why: it gives structured events, permission callbacks and cost data that parsing CLI output would not.
