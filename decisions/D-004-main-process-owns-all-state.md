## D-4 · 2026-10-23 · Main process owns all state
Repos, sessions, settings and activity live in the main process and are persisted as JSON under the app's user data directory. Transcripts are stored per session. The renderer mirrors state pushed over IPC.
Why: sessions must keep running regardless of which view is open, and approvals must resolve from any of the three places they appear.
